Multiplication and its effects on the signal and Quantization effects of Audio Signal
Goal: A function that can add two sinus waves with the amplitude of 1 with the frequency F1 and F2 and the Sampling frequency Fs with the time length of T and the signals are discrete.
Quantization of functions with Surfaces and level numbers that can quantize the sum of functions with the Surface levels and can dedicate some bits to each samples. A function that can produce the output of the Difference of a Signal and its quantization in amount of N levels.
Quantization of the numbers of bit per sample of the file that saved in the border of S using the wav quantizer function and reducing the numbers of bit per sample and analyzing the effects of the changes. Quantizing the S signal with the wav qnoise function and displaying each sample with bit number and calculating the average square of error between the primary signal and Sampling version and displaying the results with the add sin function and optimizing the level number between 2 and 16 Quantization of I in A levels with the H=imquantize(I.A) function.
